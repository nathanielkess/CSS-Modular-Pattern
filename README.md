# CSS-Modular-Pattern
An in-depth look at thinking about CSS in modular way.

**_Prologue_**

This is a port-over into git of a document I wrote to help front-end team members align their CSS coding approach.  It evolved from my experience with [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/ "A flexible guide to developing sites small and large.") and working with enterprise sized web sites. Itâ€™s re-write as a [condensed style guide here](https://github.com/nathanielkess/CSS-Style-Guide "A component base CSS style guide taking ques from OOCS and SMACSS.").
